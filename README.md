# Project 13 - ARGENT BANK

ARGENT BANK's project is a web application dedicated to their clients. They need an authentification section and the possibility to do transactions with React.

Sportsee is a part of OpenClassrooms "Front End Developer" process. For this project I used [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/) + [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation).
